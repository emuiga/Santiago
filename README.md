officers convenient access to the details of the books, including circulation and numbers as 
well as all registered patrons from a computer.<br>
Provides information like details and figures of the books and registered patrons, insertion 
of new books, deletion of lost books, limitation on issuing books, and fine on keeping a book 
more than one month from the issue date.<br>
Maintain an easy resource circulation system between library users; called patrons, and 
library officers.<br>
To improve on the existing system.<br>
Provide a better and user-friendly interface.<br>
